            <img src="images/together.jpg" width="50%" class="fleft" /><p>I truly believe in investing in youth and providing opportunties to those in disadvantages communities. By spending time each day mentoring students, the investment could spark a student discovering his or her own passion within web design and development. This also provides accessibility to traditionally underlooked communities and helps students empower themselves. As a Brooklyn native, I have seen firsthand what the investment in students, whether it be an after-school program or volunteer experience, has done for those in my community. Overall, I believe that these goals can be measured through the impact we have on the students.</p>
            <p>This opportunity would be an amazing opening to expand on networking connections. I would like to share my expertise within the technological field and learn how to better disperse it to different groups of people. This would allow for a mutually beneficial partnership, where we can both learn from each other.</p>
