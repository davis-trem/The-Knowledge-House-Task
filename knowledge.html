            <h2>Knowledge</h2>
            <img src="images/learn.jpg" width="40%" class="fleft" /><p>There are so many different areas I can learn from while working with The Knowledge House. This experience will expose me to the fundamentals of how a business is run from the ground up. As a recent graduate, I am equipt to use my academic experience and transferrable skills, ie: my experience running Georgia State University's Computer Science club and our web development workshops. I aim to make material much more coherent for my students.</p>
            <p>As an introvert, I will be able to identify patterns within students that are typically underidentified and help students reach and/or discover their potential. By going outside of my comfort zone, I will be able to grow as both an individual and even more importantly, as a mentor for the students that I will be working with.</p>
            <p>One of my life goals is successfully organizing and launching a start-up. As a recent graduate, I seek experience working with well-meaning organizations, such as non-profits. I have previously worked with a church, but the experience highlighted the structure of top-down leadership. By this opportunity, I indend to gain exposure of how leaders work together and establish a company from the ground up. I am able to offer a range of experience, from leading an organization to working within another organization. In the former, I led a team of students and sustained the organization by delegating weekly assignments. In the later, I surpassed expectations of updating All Saints Episcopal Church's website, troubleshooting both computers and helping coworkers who were not as techn-savvy.In both positions, I was depended heavily upon to fulfill each organization's tasks, make material accessible to different types of members -- and excelled.</p>
